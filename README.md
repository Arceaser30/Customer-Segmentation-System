# Customer-Segmentation-System
Introduction : The project aims to implement K-means Clustering algorithm on our website named 'ShopLane' and gather user analysis like products added to cart and trending products. 

1) Data Collection
We capture user interactions from various touchpoints, including user registrations and website engagement, gathering data on demographics, transactions, and behavioral patterns. This provides a comprehensive view of customer engagement for robust segmentation and personalized marketing strategies.

2) Data Processing
The collected data undergoes preprocessing using Python libraries:

   *Handling Missing Values: Addressing missing data through imputation or removal.
   *Outlier Detection: Detecting and treating outliers to prevent analysis distortion.
   *Standardization: Transforming numerical variables for consistency and comparability.
   
3) Segmentation Analysis
Using the Mini Batch K-means algorithm from scikit-learn, we segment customers based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and preferences. This efficient algorithm processes data in smaller batches, optimizing clustering solutions for meaningful customer segments, enhancing marketing strategies and product offerings.

4) Real-Time Data Integration
Real-time data integration provides immediate insights into customer behavior, market trends, and operational performance. This dynamic approach enables personalized customer experiences, adaptive pricing, and proactive issue resolution, ensuring competitiveness and sustained growth.

5) Real-Time Insights
Through real-time updates triggered by customer registrations and visualized via a Dash application, we quickly understand customer behavior and market trends. This enables agile strategy adaptation, offering optimization, and leveraging predictive analytics for future trend anticipation and proactive planning.

6) Optimization
Lazy Evaluation: Delays data fetching until necessary, improving efficiency.
Minimizing Redundant Model Fitting: Reusing initialized models reduces computational costs.
Reducing Callback Complexity: Simplifies code for better readability and maintainability.
Efficient Memory Management: Periodically retraining models to manage memory effectively.
Environment Variable Configuration: Configuring environment variables to mitigate memory issues, especially with Intel's MKL.
7) Evaluation
Using the silhouette score, which quantifies cluster separation, we achieved an average score of 0.44, indicating well-defined and distinct customer segments. This score validates the segmentation quality, enabling actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

8) Proposed Methodology
The methodology for customer segmentation includes defining criteria, preprocessing data, applying clustering algorithms, evaluating results, and iteratively refining the model.
